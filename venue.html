                            <p>Manchester Metropolitan University, a leading modern university, has a rich history of education dating back to 1824. It was originally established as the Manchester Mechanics' Institute on 7 April 1824, with the primary purpose of educating artisans and skilled workers in the scientific principles of their trade¹. The Manchester School of Design was opened in 1838 to support British design and reduce dependency on overseas firms¹. Over the years, the institution expanded its educational offerings, opening several schools and colleges, including the School of Education in 1878, the School of Domestic Science in 1880, and the School of Commerce in 1889. </p>
                            <p>The institution underwent several name changes and mergers over the years. It was known as the Manchester Polytechnic in 1970, and later became the Manchester Metropolitan University in 1992. Today, it is one of the largest universities in the UK, with over 40,000 students and 4,000 staff members. It continues to make significant contributions to education and research, upholding its long-standing tradition of excellence.</p>     
                            <p>The conference sits in the newly built Dalton Building at the Manchester Metropolitan University. The Dalton Building at the Manchester Metropolitan University is a state-of-the-art facility that serves as the new home for the Faculty of Science and Engineering. This building, which is the largest project ever undertaken at the University, was officially handed over to the university in June 2025. It replaced the previous John Dalton West site with a new seven-storey building, including a 200-seat "super lab". The building is designed to be dynamic, with open study and social spaces on every floor, fostering interaction among students and researchers from various disciplines within the faculty. The Dalton Building provides a professional study environment with purpose-built teaching and research spaces for each subject area. This significant investment into STEM education and research supports key strategic areas including health and wellbeing, sustainable energy, advanced materials and manufacturing, and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
