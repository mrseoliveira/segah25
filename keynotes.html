                        from UCL, and a BEng in Computer Science from Beihang University, Beijing, China. Her research interest is the use of
                        Virtual Reality as a medium for real-time social interaction, in particular in the application areas of medical training
                        and therapy. Her work in social anxiety in VR and moral decisions in VR has been featured multiple times in the media,
                        including BBC Horizon, the New Scientist magazine, and the Wall Street Journal. Her 2017 Coursera VR specialisation
                        attracted over 100,000 learners globally, and she co-leads on the MA/MSc in Virtual and Augmented Reality at Goldsmiths

                            Healthcare is growingly incorporating new assistance delivery models that rely on the use of gaming and virtual reality
                            technologies. Virtual reality has a lot of potential because it allows the creation of paradigms that explore the role
                            of personalization of training, the use of various types of feedback, and engagement by incorporating tasks in game
                            contexts. In addition, through these tools we can monitor patients and have a precise and objective quantification of
                            their performance and recovery over time. In this presentation, I will describe different paradigms that combine virtual
                            reality, games, neurosciences, and clinical guidelines with the objective of validating interactive systems specifically
                            designed for applications for health and wellbeing. I will particularly focus on aspects such as the personalization of
                            tasks and content. The impact of these paradigms will be illustrated with the results from controlled studies with
                            end-users.

                            Reality (VR) technologies for stroke rehabilitation, exploring specific brain mechanisms that relate to functional
                            recovery to approach motor and cognitive stroke rehabilitation by means of non-invasive and low-cost technologies. Her
                            research addresses aspects such as serious gaming and personalization of training. More recently, Mónica has also been
                            interested in VR for mental health applications. In 2016, Mónica has been awarded the ISVR Early Career Investigator

At the University of Florida, we are working closely with NVIDIA to create the initial prototype of an intelligent hospital. By creating a digital twin of a hospital, we are accomplishing three incredible technological achievements. The hospital digital twin can be controlled through VR, all interactions and access points are controlled through smart contracts on Blockchain, and all interactions are run through an AI engine to determine the best responses. It is through the combination of AI, Blockchain, and VR, that the field of healthcare is about to experience the next step in its evolution.<b></b>
